My name is Vaughn Miller.  I am an experienced endpoint engineer currently working in Higher Education.

This is my professional blog where I am posting information related to OS deployment, scripting, and endpoint management.  I have long benefitted from information published by other professionals, and this blog is my humble attempt to give back to the community.  However you found your way here, I hope you find the information helpful.
