My name is Vaughn Miller.  I am a Desktop Engineer at Lafayette College in Easton PA.

This is my professional blog where I am posting information related to OS deployment, scripting, and client management.  I have long benefitted from information published by other professionals (with the help of my friend Google), and this blog is my humble attempt to give back to the community.  However you found your way here, I hope you find the information helpful.

I can be found on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@vmiller), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaughn-miller-a4799742), and [GitHub](https://github.com/vmiller)
