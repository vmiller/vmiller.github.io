With version 14.1 of the desktop app, Mathematica.app is now Wolfram.app. In addition to a new path and a new bundle identifier for the application, there is also a new path if you deploy a mathpass file as we do in our organization.

`/Library/Mathematica/Licensing/mathpass` as of version 14.1 becomes `/Library/Wolfram/Licensing/mathpass`
